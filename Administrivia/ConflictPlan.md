## Conflict Plan

> What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Use communication to gather all of our thoughts, have it WRITTEN down for more clear paths to ones words

 > What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Come together as a team, get everyone back on track on the project.
* Make task list for everyone on every level to complete
* All else fails find a teacher

> How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Use our communication and teaching skills to try to get everyone up to speed, and have everyone re-explain the project

> How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* Approach them and use communication together as a team as needed

> How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

* When words are not being heard, and words can not written down on paper is one way we are working as a team and will be beneficial to grab an outside source to future help
