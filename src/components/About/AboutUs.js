                  Veteran, software developer, stock trader. I also worked for a surveying and engineering firm for a while. I live in Idaho. Hobbies include fishing, cooking, landscaping. I like to work with my hands, I spend a lot of my free time restoring my home and learning a lot of the trades that go along with that. So I'm becoming a bit of a jack of all trades master of none, at least not yet.

                  Massage Therapist to Software Developer <br /><br />

                  Hiking, playing games, watching anime, and movies are some of my favorite hobbies. Helping people has always been a thing I love to do! Seeing the joy and motivation you can bring to someone is always a wonderful knowing that I can do that with coding and help those around me to push ourselves will be something I look forward to!

                  I grew up on a dairy farm in the hills of  Vermont. In 2013, I enlisted in the Navy directly after graduating from the University of New Hampshire. I've always enjoyed math and logic. I decided to pursue software and not only start a career in development, but to pursue my masters in engineering. Outside of writing software I'm a marathoner (Boston Marathon qualifier), mountaineer (Mt. Whitney, highest in lower 48), and skier! I'm currently training for an Ultra Marathon in the Olympic mountains this fall.</p>
